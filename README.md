## Technologies
- **Backend**: Developed in `C#`.
- **Frontend**: User interface developed using `React.js`.
- **Database**: Managed using `SQL`.

---

## System Requirements
Before getting started, make sure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher): To run the client-side.
- **Visual Studio** with support for `.NET Framework`: To run the server-side.
- **SQL Server** installed: For database management.

## Steps to Run the System

### 1. Backend Setup
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Update the database connection string (`Connection String`) in the `appsettings.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server-name;Database=CityCarDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
       }
   }
   ```
3. Run the migrations to create the database:
   ```powershell
   Update-Database
   ```
4. Start the server:
   - Click `Start` or use the shortcut `F5`.

### 2. Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client-side folder (React App) in the terminal:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/client
   ```
2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### 3. Database Setup
1. Ensure the `CityCarDB` database has been successfully created.
2. If there is seed data, run the appropriate code in Visual Studio.
